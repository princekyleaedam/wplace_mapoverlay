A map of the region data in wplace. Each color is a different country.

Data sourced from u/OkInfluence36 on reddit.

I haven't made individual country selection yet, probably soon.
Additionally, the code isn't that optimized.

Disclaimer: I used AI to write the code for sorting through data and making the map, so keep that in mind.
